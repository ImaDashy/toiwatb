      "content": "# Kavindaism\n\n Buddhism is so often portrayed as a liberating and spiritual experience, so my apparent rejection of it can be difficult to explain to others. People often put it down to rebellion for rebellion’s sake. I feel like a child who ran away from the circus, to go to university and become a straight-laced accountant. Take that, Bearded Mum and World’s Strongest Dad.
\n\n But the beliefs instilled in us throughout our childhood can be difficult to quell. The leopard can’t change it’s spots[^1]; the accountant can’t help but juggle his stationery. Despite my best efforts, my mind and heart clung to the notion of Karma; What Goes Around Comes Around. Of all the complex Buddhist teachings, I have no justification for my choice to believe in this one philosophy. There was no epiphany, no profound chain of events in which I witnessed Karma with my own eyes. Frankly I just liked the idea of the whole thing.
\n\n This cherry-picked belief has shaped my world view so significantly that it makes me glad I only chose one idea to take to heart. Who knows how distorted my life would have seemed if I’d followed everything I read or learned about with such conviction. Karma encourages me to do positive things for the world, like carry an old lady’s bag up the stairs, or feed breadcrumbs to a squirrel. It helps me forgive others grievances against me, safe in the knowledge that they may soon walk into a glass door or be bitten by a well-fed squirrel. It also compels me to make decisions that other people would find absurd or naive, but that I think helps me earn Frequent Karmic Points, a case in point being my arrival into Paris.
