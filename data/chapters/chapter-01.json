His mother was present for the entire interview. KA claimed to remember a life in Istanbul some 850 km away. He said his family’s name had been Karakas and he had been an Armenian Christian. He was rich and lived in a large three-story house. He said people called him Fistik and his wife and children had Greek first names. He also said he often carried a large leather bag and he only lived in the house for part of the year. He said he had been shot and killed and his wife was involved in the murder. In addition, he mentioned that his youngest son had died as a rally car driver.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-474d83fe-7fff-57f0-7f02-7a5bc340823f\"><br></b></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">His first resurfacing occurred at the age of two.

Miranda would then fall silent, her face hidden from view. After a pause, her silence would become a fit of giggles, breaking into genuine laughter and delight, as she would stand to deliver the grand finale “Who knew our Ewen was already on his second life. Talk about the terrible twos!”</span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">It wasn't a great punchline but when Ewen was younger, he would relish taking part in this retelling with his mother.

He would lie in bed listening to his mother launch into the tale and gently rub his wrists, still feeling the coarse rope cutting into his skin. The smell of the oil he used to burn Prak’s fishing nets and boats would sting his nostrils, though he still couldn’t remember </span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">why </span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">he had done it. He’d close his eyes and see the anger on the faces of the crew as they dragged him from his bed, beat his lean body and bound his limbs.

They'd smile weakly, eyes darting nervously, each wondering how a series of small, seemingly sensible decisions had led them to become a captive audience to this one-woman show. After the goodbyes and the goodnights and the we-should-do-this-agains, they'd huddle on the street by their cars, shivering in the Welsh night air, whispering about what had transpired.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Could it be true?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"The lad remembers a past life?\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Does this mean that God, and Heaven, and Hell, and Salvation, are losing out to some eastern Karmic bosh?”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">“What was the name of that boat ride at Disneyland again?”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-id=\"fn-1\">[1]</sup></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Though the questions were heavy and the answers scarce, they would all agree that coming to the widow’s house tonight was a mistake.

The memories started from deep within him and would gently drift to the surface, like my swim trunks that time I tried the high-dive at our local pool. There, they would bob and bubble alongside his present reality for all to see, while he struggled to put them back where they belonged before anybody noticed or peeked underwater.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">At the age of four, while riding on his fathers shoulders, a vivid memory of riding horseback on a cold sunny day resurfaced. His fathers hair wasn’t quite the mahogany mane of his Paso horse, and the aisles of Tesco weren’t quite the towering peaks of the Andes, but for a few minutes he was transported back to his life as a Peruvian rancher, the fabled </span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">chalán.</span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\"> Andy, having noticed the boy had gone quiet, twisted his neck and asked “Everything okay, mate?” Ewen, wide-eyed and dazed, could only manage to whisper, “Si”. When he was six, he delighted in being able to draw near-perfect hieroglyphics, while his classmates were more interested in eating the crayons. By the age of nine, Ewen had been buffeted by most all the winds of the human condition. He had felt love, grief, exuberance, longing, rage and despair in memories that were as visceral as they were fleeting. He had spoken lost dialects and worshipped deities of every name. He had been a mother, a brother, a savior, a traitor; brave, helpless, cunning and apathetic, sometimes all in a single lifetime. He had been the person that claps when a plane lands and he had been the person that rolls their eyes at those who did.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">He had died countless deaths.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">And yet…he was also ten years old. He lived in a small house in the Welsh countryside and went to a weathered school bursting with rowdy children. He recently found out a “full moon” could also refer to someone’s bottom, and couldn’t stop giggling.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-id=\"fn-2\">[2]</sup> He loved his Mum and he missed his Dad. Despite the occasional reenactment of a gruesome death, Ewen had managed to have a fairly quaint childhood. Besides, as he got older, the resurfacings had become less and less frequent. In fact, it had been almost a year since his last episode.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">****</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">“It won’t light, it’s too wet.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">“You’re holding it upside down, try it this way!”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">“He was holding it fine, it won’t make a difference.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">“What do you know, you sycophant.”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">“I know my cousin lost two of his middle fingers playing with one of these.

Ewen found himself behind the old cowshed with his classmates Maya and Dylan. The fireworks that Dylan had stolen from his older brother had been all the children could talk about that morning but the traditional dampness of the Welsh summer was making lighting the fuse difficult. Maya and Dylan had both tried and failed, so now it was Ewen’s turn.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Maya had been a late addition to their grade but had quickly become one of Ewen’s closest friends. While other kids and parents had found his resurfacings distasteful , Maya thought they were the most interesting thing about living in Bridgend. In years gone by she had waited impatiently for each episode so that she could learn as much as she could about whatever time and place Ewen was reliving. She kept a detailed log of each and every resurfacing and all the things she had discovered, with a clinical focus on swear words in different languages that would make a polyglottal sailor weep.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Dylan, on the other hand, was somewhere between an acquaintance and a nuisance. He was like one of those spiders that appear in the same corner of your living room each night. You’re not thrilled about them being there but they’ve so far been harmless and you don’t want to upset the delicate truce that's formed by trying to get rid of them, lest they jump onto your face while you sleep. Plus their brother has access to fireworks, so that’s something.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">“There it goes, I got it.

A feeble puff of smoke escaped, like a kitten sneezing into a bowl of flour. The children watched in anticipation, squinted eyes and fingers in ears. The explosive lay dormant. Seconds passed. And passed. And passed. Finally, Maya turned to Ewen, \"</span><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Are you sure you did it rig-”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">CRACK!</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">The sound ricocheted off the concrete and struck Ewen between the eyes like shrapnel.

She didn’t speak much English and I couldn’t speak Spanish. Despite this, I learned that she loved Disneyland, especially the ride with the boats. She knew the Spanish name for the ride, but to her frustration she just couldn’t quite recall what it was called in English. Fast forward to the end of the night. We’re back at her hotel room. Layers of clothing are coming off until I’m standing in front of her, stark naked. She looks me up and down, sizing me up, and suddenly clicks her fingers and exclaims “OH! It’s a small world after all!”</span></span>"
