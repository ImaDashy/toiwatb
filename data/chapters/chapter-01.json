The haggard face was barely recognizable as human from beast, living from dead.</p><p>\"It must be at least 100 years old\", whispered Maya.</p><p>\"I'm only 37\" the figure crooned indignantly. \"You try having two kids under three. Still, I remember the before-times. The days when we made films like White Chicks. When you could say <em>ex-squeeze me</em> instead of <em>excuse me</em> and make an entire room full of people laugh.\"</p><p>\"I don't get it\" wondered YYY, \"is the joke just mispronunciation?\"</p><p>\"Oh, you're such a Phoebe\" the figure smiled, gently shaking its head. It let out a deep sigh, which turned into a yawn, which ended in a coughing fit. Thin wisps of hair detached themselves from the already balding head, like dandelions floating away on a summer breeze.</p><p>\"Yes, only 37. I remember when Instagram used to be an app for looking at your friends' pictures, in chronological order. It's true. Scrolling Instagram was like walking through a great hall, with sunlight streaming in from beautiful arched windows below vaulted ceilings. You would walk leisurely, feeling safe and warm, as people in your life would walk towards you. As they passed, they would hold up a picture they had recently taken. Your friend would show you a photo from their holiday to Greece. Looks great, you would beam, as they walked on by. Your neighbour would show you a photo of their engagement ring. Wonderful news, you'd gush, as they strolled past you. Your coworker would show you a picture of their breakfast. Not as impressive as the others, you'd say, but thank you for sharing. It was a serene experience.\"</p><p>XXX and YYY glanced at each other, and slowly started backing out of the room,</p><p>\"Scrolling Instagram now is like creeping along a narrow, dingy corridor, barely wide enough to stretch out your arms. The walls are greasy and the carpet is damp. Strangers push past you in the opposite direction, their scowling faces briefly visible under the flickering fluorescent lights. \"Men have rights too\", one whispers, glaring at you. \"Fucking immigrants\" another growls as he bumps your shoulder, sending you into the grimy wall. You try to find your way back to the light, to the great halls you once knew, but it's just corridor after mouldy corridor. And all the while, you can hear the heavy footsteps of the algorithm. Oh, the algorithm. It stalks you; relentless, ever-closerâ€¦\"</p><p>By now XXX and YYY</p>",
