His mother was present for the entire interview. KA claimed to remember a life in Istanbul some 850 km away. He said his family’s name had been Karakas and he had been an Armenian Christian. He was rich and lived in a large three-story house. He said people called him Fistik and his wife and children had Greek first names. He said he and his wife’s wedding took place in Bodrum, a town on the coast approximately 430 km from Istanbul by air. He also said he often carried a large leather bag and he only lived in the house for part of the year. He said he had been shot and killed and his wife was involved in the murder. In addition, he mentioned that his youngest son had died as a rally car driver.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-474d83fe-7fff-57f0-7f02-7a5bc340823f\"><br></b></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\">****</b></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">His first resurfacing occurred at the age of two. It became one of Ewen’s mother’s favourite stories to thrill dinner guests with.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"You won't believe this,\" Miranda would begin, leaning forward conspiratorially. \"Andy and I took little Ewen to Disneyland Paris. He couldn’t even pronounce tomato at that age.\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">At this point, she'd always stand up, wine glass in hand, using it as a prop.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"So there we are, getting into that boat ride—you know the one with all the singing dolls—and suddenly Ewen starts thrashing around like a caught fish! Out of nowhere!\" She'd demonstrate, jerking her body awkwardly. \"Then he starts screaming in what sounds like gibberish to us!\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Miranda would lower her voice dramatically, the way I did to impress girls in primary school. \"But this young couple nearby, they were Vietnamese or something. They hear him and look horrified. The husband rushes over to me and says, 'Your son is speaking Khmer. He's saying: My wrists, my wrists, untie my wrists. I told you it was an accident. Don't do this, please my wrists. I'll pay you back, you can take my snakeheads. Please NO PLEASE!'\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">By this point of the story, Miranda would be face down on the carpet, writhing and holding her arms like a soccer player who had been patted on the back. She would then fall silent, her face hidden from view. After a pause, her silence would become a fit of giggles, breaking into genuine laughter and delight, as she would stand to deliver the grand finale “Who knew our Ewen was already on his second life. Talk about the terrible twos!”</span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">It wasn't a great punchline but when Ewen was younger, he would relish taking part in this retelling with his mother. As soon as he heard his mother begin the now familiar introduction to the story, he would leap from his bed and run into the dining room in his dinosaur pyjamas to offer more details and corrections.</span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">“No Mum, I was Cambodian, not Vietnamese!”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">“Snakeheads are a fish, I was the best at catching them, I could do it with my bare hands!”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">“They tied my legs too Mum, don’t forget, I couldn’t kick like that!”&nbsp;</span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">As Ewen got older and more memories of his life as Kosal emerged, he grew less interested in reliving his death of 1912. He would lie in bed listening to his mother launch into the tale and gently rub his wrists, still feeling the coarse rope cutting into his skin. The smell of the oil he used to burn Prak’s fishing nets and boats would sting his nostrils, though he still couldn’t remember </span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:italic;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">why </span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">he had done it. He’d close his eyes and see the anger on the faces of the crew as they dragged him from his bed, beat his lean body and bound his limbs. The cold glint of Prak’s eyes as he pushed Kosal overboard, as cold and as black as the water that engulfed him and dragged him down, down…</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">For their part, the guests would sit in polite, uncomfortable silence as Miranda transformed the living room into the stage for this Cambodian fishing feud. They'd smile weakly, eyes darting nervously, each wondering how a series of small, seemingly sensible decisions had led them to become a captive audience to this one-woman show. After the goodbyes and the goodnights and the we-should-do-this-agains, they'd huddle on the street by their cars, shivering in the Welsh night air, whispering about what had transpired.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Could it be true?\"</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"The lad remembers a past life?\"&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Does this mean that God, and Heaven, and Hell, and Salvation, are losing out to some eastern Karmic bosh?”</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">“What was the name of that boat ride at Disneyland again?”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-id=\"fn-1\">[1]</sup></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Though the questions were heavy and the answers scarce, they would all agree that coming to the widow’s house tonight was a mistake.

The memories started from deep within him and would gently drift to the surface, like my swim trunks that time I tried the high-dive at our local pool.

Layers of clothing are coming off until I’m standing in front of her, stark naked. She looks me up and down, sizing me up, and suddenly clicks her fingers and exclaims “OH!
