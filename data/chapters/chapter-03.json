Her parents were Moonbeam and Cosmic Ray, though before their 1987 spiritual awakening in a Glastonbury field they were simply Margaret and James. Their Cotswolds cottage had been a revolving door of healing crystals, visiting shamans and neighbours who'd pop round to discuss Reiki over homemade kombucha. By age sixteen, Miranda could read tarot cards, knew which variety of sage could bless a room and had had her chakras realigned more times than a mystic with scoliosis.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">It was for precisely this reason that she fell for Andy Hartwell.

Take that, Bearded Mum and World’s Strongest Dad. But our childhood beliefs can be difficult to quell. The leopard can’t change its spots; the accountant can’t help but juggle her stationery. Despite her best efforts, her mind and heart still clung to various cosmic notions of fate and Karma. Ewen's arrival and his logic-defying resurfacings was the final nudge sending her right back into the New Age pit she'd clawed out of.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">Before she knew it, she had become the sort of person her younger self would have found insufferably authentic. The type who composted religiously and could discuss the merits of different yoga poses with the earnestness of a mystic who had been cured of his scoliosis. Andy, of course, had fallen in love with her all over again. His support was unwavering; bringing worms for the compost and forcing himself to relearn how to sit cross-legged, an ability he had lost in his teens.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">The pottery wheel had been his last gift to her, ordered online two weeks before the accident but arriving three weeks after the funeral.

It was exactly what Andy would have quipped had he been standing right beside her. Today, her kitchen shelves were lined with wonky bowls and mugs, lopsided and bent over like they had eaten bad Taco Bell the night before. Ewen called them “Mum’s Tipoverware” and refused to drink his morning orange juice from anything else.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space-collapse: preserve;\">She was preparing supper in one of these very bowls when Ewen approached with a question.

But the moment her soles touched the Cardiff airport tarmac, all of that ceased to matter. In an instant, she became little more than the new Asian lady in town. The transition had been harder than she had anticipated. Not the language, she'd grown up speaking English alongside Punjabi and Malay (was this where Maya got her love of foreign swear words?). It wasn’t even the Welsh weather, which I believe I have mentioned two or three thousand times already. It was the invisibility that surprised her.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">The first weeks alone in their small rental while her family ventured into new lives felt like several lifetimes.

She quickly discovered being a crossing guard was like being the mayor of a very small, mobile city. She knew which children were plotting to skip school, which teachers were entangled in various trysts and whose un-newtered dog was responsible for the new litter of puppies at number forty-seven. She also learned the best way to withstand hours of Welsh rain was to simply imagine she was back in Sabah, standing directly under the Mahua waterfall fully clothed and for some reason holding a giant stop sign. The role gave her a community and purpose. She never tired of hearing children and parents call her Miss Jazz. Most importantly, she no longer felt invisible. In fact, she felt more seen than ever, though to be fair she did wear a fluro-yellow vest.&nbsp;</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Now folding laundry in the front room, she heard Maya's footsteps on the path outside.

He was bright, well-mannered and had forged a deep bond with Maya and Hari. Jasleen was a firm believer that the occasional speaking in tongues or graphic ancient ritual sacrifice shouldn't stand in the way of true camaraderie. She had also formed an unlikely friendship with Miranda. When the Singh’s first arrived in Bridgend, Miranda had been overzealous in assuming that a woman from Asia would naturally share her newfound spiritual interests. Jasleen, with her analytical mind and practical worldview, had gently corrected this misconception. But after Andy’s accident when Miranda needed a tangible shoulder to cry on rather than vague cosmic platitudes, Jasleen showed up and never left. Their friendship was the sort cobbled together from impromptu dinners, emergency school drop offs and the comfortable silence of two mothers who understood loss.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Maya had now wandered into the room, settling herself at the edge of the bed with the sort of nonchalance that immediately put her mother on high alert. \"Ma,” she began, “you know what's really unfair?\".</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">\"What's unfair, beta?\" Jasleen asked, knowing full well she was about to find out whether she wanted to or not.&nbsp;</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">\"Well, it's just that Ewen has this whole other family he's never met.

Nine years in Paris as a chronically single thirty-four year old left him with no clue about what the city might offer a child. He had turned to online research, learning both about Paris but also children in general. He was embarrassed to admit one of his Google searches even included “child food”, as if kid’s meals were sold the same way as kibble or bird seed.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" data-id=\"fn-6\">[6]</sup></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\"> Ultimately, he’d stocked his refrigerator with various brands of chicken nuggets and chocolate milk, and called it a day.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">The train pulled in with a hiss of brakes and general commotion of disembarking passengers. Joseph held his sign higher and scanned the crowd for a small boy who would look like Andy. This was the part he'd been dreading. Seeing Andy's features in miniature, alive and animated in a way both wonderful and heartbreaking, like the custom-made bobble head I bought for my wife after couples therapy. </span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">People assumed being fraternal twins meant they were alike, but sharing a birthday was where Joseph and Andy's similarities ended. Joseph had been the tall one, Andy the short one. Andy supported Manchester United with Taylor Swift stan fanaticism, while Joseph's Liverpool allegiance was worn lightly, like those paper underwear they give you for massages. Where Joseph drifted through life like a plastic bag in the wind, like in that Katy Perry song, Andy roared and danced through the fire of life, like in that other Katy Perry song. Andy had been the rock, the Dwayne Johnson, that gave Joseph the courage to live whimsically. Since he'd gone, Joseph found himself second-guessing everything, as if Andy's absence had stolen not just his brother but his own ability to navigate the world without worry.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">The crowd thinned. A few latecomers hurried past, dragging suitcases and checking phones. Still no nephew. Joseph lowered his sign and checked his watch. Perhaps the boy was confused, or needed help with luggage. A conductor walked the train length, checking compartments. Nothing. Something cold settled in his stomach. Eventually, Joseph was alone on the platform, holding his ridiulous sign and trying to make sense of what had gone wrong. Mix-up with tickets? Had Ewen changed his mind? Something worse? Panic rose in his chest (he had seen Taken 2) when mercifully his phone buzzed.&nbsp; A text from an unknown number: \"Hi Uncle Joe,” it began.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Joseph stared at the message for an age before putting his phone away. He felt completely at sea, a feeling he had become accustomed to where his brother's family was concerned. He carefully made his way back through the station toward the ticketing office. Joseph caught his reflection in a shop window, a man holding a forlorn sign, looking lost in his own city. Worry tugged at his ankles like the receding tide, threatening to upset his footing and drag him back into the churning waters of his brother’s absence</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; background-color: transparent; font-style: italic; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; font-variant-emoji: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">.</span></p></span></span></div>",
